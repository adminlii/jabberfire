        This module first fixes several blocking modules to be be non-blocking,
        then imports the required modules from the application. Then the application
        object is created and the server is started.

        **Advantages**:
         - Initiating the application object and keeping it isolated from the submodules
           of the application keeps it from being unnecessarily tinkered with and behavior
           being modified in unexpected ways.
